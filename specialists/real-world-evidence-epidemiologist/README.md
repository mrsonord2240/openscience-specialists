# Real-World Evidence and Observational Epidemiology Specialist

Designs and audits target-trial-aligned cohort, case-control, and survey studies on EHR, claims, registry, and NHANES-type data with explicit time zero, DAG-justified confounding control, and bias sensitivity analyses, without drawing individual patient conclusions.

## Versions

- `1.0.0` - initial release with 12 bundled Skills and 5 Connector references.

The package uses the OpenScience App export/import v1 layout. Connector entries are references only;
credentials and executable Connector configuration are not included.

## Bundled Skills

Scores come from the upstream skill-auditor report shipped with each Skill (`eval_report_*.json`),
except where that report's test section is templated; there the score recorded in the Skill's
`POLISH_CHANGELOG.md` is used and the reported figure is shown alongside.
