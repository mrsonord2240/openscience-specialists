# Specialist authoring

Production Specialist versions live here; protocol fixtures do not. Add exactly one immutable SemVer
version per contribution:

For a copyable walkthrough with all required files, see the repository's non-publishable
[contribution example](../example/README.md).

```text
specialists/<specialist-id>/
├── README.md
└── versions/
    └── <semver>/
        ├── release.config.json
        └── package/
            ├── manifest.json
            ├── specialist.json
            ├── skills/
            │   └── <skill-id>/
            │       ├── SKILL.md
            │       └── ...
            ├── README.txt
            └── ... optional ordinary attachments
```

`README.txt` and ordinary regular-file attachments such as licenses and supporting documents are
optional. The ZIP root is not limited to a content whitelist. The complete contents of `package/`
are zipped and safety-scanned, but only `skills/<skill-id>/...` enters the installed Specialist;
other attachments are not installed or executed. Packages must remain compatible with OpenScience
App export/import v1. Do not add a plugin manifest or `.claude-plugin`.

`release.config.json` has four strict fields:

- `source`: HTTPS `repository`, full 40-character lowercase `commit`, and `license`;
- `marketplace`: `display_name`, `summary`, optional `author`, and publisher `id`, `name`, and HTTPS
  `url`;
- `skills`: each Skill's stable `id`/`name`, display text, description, and canonical
  `skills/<skill-id>` path;
- `connectors`: reference-only `id`, `required`, and `default_selected` flags.

All Specialist, Skill, Connector, and publisher IDs use strict lowercase kebab-case: alphanumeric
segments separated by single hyphens, with no leading or trailing hyphen.

`publisher` is the required publication and source subject. Keep its stable ID, display name, and URL
separate from `author`, which is optional displayed authorship credit. Author values are trimmed,
limited to 160 characters, and omitted from generated listing data when missing, blank, or null.
Official Publisher metadata uses ID `aipoch` and display name `AIPOCH`.

`specialist.json` uses the Protocol v1 package contract: required `name`, `description`,
`system_prompt`, `skill_ids`, and `connector_ids`, plus optional `display_name`. Unknown fields and
camelCase aliases are rejected. The default ID arrays must agree with the release config. Never
include secrets, credentials, commands, or Connector server configuration.

Build one version locally with:

```bash
npm run build:release -- --specialist-id <id> --version <semver>
```

Generated files go to ignored `dist/`; maintainers dispatch the protected workflow with the
Specialist ID, and it resolves the version and source commit from reviewed repository content.
