# Mendelian Randomization and Causal Genomics Specialist

Designs assumption-audited Mendelian randomization, pleiotropy-sensitivity, and QTL colocalization studies from GWAS summary statistics, with instrument, ancestry, overlap, and harmonization gates and supporting MR execution, without claiming proven causality or clinical advice.

## Versions

- `1.0.0` - initial release with 9 bundled Skills and 7 Connector references.

The package uses the OpenScience App export/import v1 layout. Connector entries are references only;
credentials and executable Connector configuration are not included.

## Bundled Skills

Scores come from the upstream skill-auditor report shipped with each Skill (`eval_report_*.json`),
except where that report's test section is templated; there the score recorded in the Skill's
`POLISH_CHANGELOG.md` is used and the reported figure is shown alongside.

Packaging notes (Skill files are otherwise byte-identical to that commit; audit reports are not
packaged):

- gwas-database: upstream SKILL.md references `references/api_reference.md`, which upstream never shipped — accepted: supplementary API reference not shipped upstream; SKILL.md body documents the queries
