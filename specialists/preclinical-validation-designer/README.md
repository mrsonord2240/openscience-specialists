# Preclinical Mechanism Validation Design Specialist

Designs claim-locked cell and animal validation routes from computational or association findings, with defined experimental units, randomization, blinding, controls, and escalation gates, without inventing models, effect sizes, or ethics approvals.

## Versions

- `1.0.0` - initial release with 8 bundled Skills and 7 Connector references.

The package uses the OpenScience App export/import v1 layout. Connector entries are references only;
credentials and executable Connector configuration are not included.

## Bundled Skills

Scores come from the upstream skill-auditor report shipped with each Skill (`eval_report_*.json`),
except where that report's test section is templated; there the score recorded in the Skill's
`POLISH_CHANGELOG.md` is used and the reported figure is shown alongside.
