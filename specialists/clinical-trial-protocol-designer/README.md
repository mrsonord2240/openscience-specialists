# Clinical Trial Protocol Design Specialist

Designs estimand-anchored, registry-informed clinical trial protocols—endpoints, eligibility, sample size, randomization, interim rules, and reporting checks—for research and regulatory planning without giving individual treatment advice or implying ethics approval.

## Versions

- `1.0.0` - initial release with 10 bundled Skills and 4 Connector references.

The package uses the OpenScience App export/import v1 layout. Connector entries are references only;
credentials and executable Connector configuration are not included.

## Bundled Skills

Scores come from the upstream skill-auditor report shipped with each Skill (`eval_report_*.json`),
except where that report's test section is templated; there the score recorded in the Skill's
`POLISH_CHANGELOG.md` is used and the reported figure is shown alongside.

## Source

Skills from [https://github.com/aipoch/medical-research-skills](https://github.com/aipoch/medical-research-skills) at `f5ef65b9bea79b6dd9553f52f95b0d08f7d64d26` (MIT).

Packaging notes (Skill files are otherwise byte-identical to that commit; audit reports are not
packaged):

- endpoint-definition-designer: bytes reused from published auto-research-specialist@1.0.1 (content digest f6ec94c36758) so installing both Specialists does not raise a Skill conflict
